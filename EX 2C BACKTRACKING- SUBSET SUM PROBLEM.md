# EX:2C - BACKTRACKING - SUBSET SUM PROBLEM
## DATE:

## AIM:

To demonstrate that the sum of the subset of a given set is equal to the given sum.


## Algorithm

1. Read an integer n for the size of the array, take n inputs to form the array arr.
2. Read the integer x, the target sum to be achieved by subsets.
3. Use a loop to generate subsets of all lengths from 0 to n using combinations(arr, i).
4. For each generated subset, calculate the sum of its elements. If the sum of the current subset is equal to x, consider it a valid subset.
5. Print each subset that matches the target sum.

from itertools import combinations;

def subsetSum(n, arr, x):
	
	# Iterating through all possible
	# subsets of arr from lengths 0 to n:
	for i in range (n+1):
		for subset in combinations(arr, i):
			# printing the subset if its sum is x:
			if sum(subset) == x:
				print(list(subset))

n=int(input())
arr=[]
for i in range(0,n):
    a=int(input())
    arr.append(a)
x = int(input())

subsetSum(n, arr, x)

```

## Result:

The Subset Sum program executed successfully, and the result was determined based on whether a subset matching the target sum was found or not.
