# EX:2A - BACKTRACKING - RAT IN MAZE PROBLEM
## DATE:

## AIM:

To implement the Rat in a Maze problem using backtracking and find all possible paths from the start to the destination in a given maze.


## Algorithm:

1. Initialize a 2D list maze to represent the grid (with 1 as path and 0 as blocked), and a 2D list sol of the same size filled with 0s to track the solution path.
2. Begin solving from the top-left cell (0, 0) using a recursive function to explore valid paths.
3. At each step, check if the current cell is within bounds and has a value of 1 to confirm it's a valid move.
4. Recursively attempt to move to the right (x, y+1) or down (x+1, y) to find a path to the goal.
5. If the destination (N-1, N-1) is reached, print the solution matrix. If no path is found, backtrack by resetting the cell and return false.

## Result:

The Rat in a Maze program executed successfully, and a valid path from the start to the destination was found and display.
